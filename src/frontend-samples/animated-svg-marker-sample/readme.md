# Marker Pin Sample

Copyright Â© Bentley Systems, Incorporated. All rights reserved.

This sample demonstrates how to use the [@bentley/imodel-react-hooks](/FIXME) package for simple [Markers](https://www.imodeljs.org/learning/frontend/markers/).
With arbitrary dynamic jsx passed to jsxElement, we can do anything React+HTML can on top of world space.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate the following:

- Implementing a [PrimitiveTool](https://www.imodeljs.org/reference/imodeljs-frontend/tools/primitivetool/) to collect user input and add new markers to the viewport.

## Description

[Markers](https://www.imodeljs.org/learning/frontend/markers/) are a common technique to draw a user's attention to a particular spatial location within a digital twin.  Markers are typically organized into [marker sets](https://www.imodeljs.org/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/markerset/) and displayed by a [decorator](https://www.imodeljs.org/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/decorator/).

This sample illustrates two ways to construct a MarkerSet.  The first way uses a collection of points.  For the sample, the points are generated programmatically (random, circle, etc.) but in a real application those points would come from a database or other repository of information.  The second way allows the user to manually enter the marker locations.  To enable this, the sample implements a very simple [PrimitiveTool](https://www.imodeljs.org/reference/imodeljs-frontend/tools/primitivetool/) to collect the user's mouse clicks.

This sample also illustrates a way that users can interact with a Marker.  By implementing [Marker.onMouseButton](https://www.imodeljs.org/reference/imodeljs-frontend/views/marker/#onmousebutton), the sample will pop up a small menu when the user clicks on a marker.  Some simple actions are included in the popup menu to serve as examples.
